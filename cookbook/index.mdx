This page is a placeholder, a stub. It's here to help visualize the new structure, but it is temporarily devoid of content.

Since it's an "overview" page, its contents will be written after writing the contents of the respective categories.

> DUBIOUS! Perhaps, all or most relevant cookbooks should simply be a part of the Build section of the Guidebook OR be placed close to the corresponding Reference docs: Jetton cookbook near the Jetton reference documentation, etc.
