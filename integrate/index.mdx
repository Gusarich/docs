## TON Connect

To integrate with TON, the standard wallet connection protocol is used — TON Connect. It is similar to WalletConnect on Ethereum, and enables secure communication between wallets and decentralized applications, allowing users to authorize transactions while maintaining control of their private keys.

Currently, TON Connect supports over 30 wallets and connects to hundreds of major applications across the TON ecosystem. As the mandatory connection protocol for all Telegram Mini Apps, it serves as the gateway to TON's entire ecosystem of applications and services.

Think of it as the essential infrastructure that your institutional clients will need to access any TON-based services — from DeFi protocols to gaming applications to payment systems.
